    	<p style="padding:5%; font-size:17px; font-weight:200">An app for Android that encrypt and decrypt messages for use in other apps. I used Java to encrypt the messages using a Vigen√®re cipher. The user enters a keyword and the app encrpyts the message based on ASCII values. A copy button allows the user to copy the encrypted text to the clipboard for easy transfering to other apps.</p>
    	<p style="padding:5%; font-size:17px; font-weight:200">A future implementation could be to integrate it with an existing messaging app or to create a new messaging app with the encryption as a built in feature.</p>
